# Student Tool Application
# Summary of Vision
To create a program in Java and MySQL that helps students record and plan their classes. It will utilize a friendly, user interface and will maintain accounts to save data within an online database. 
# What
Class Planner will be a desktop application with a graphical user interface made from Javaâ€™s Window Builder.
# Why
We noticed from our own experiences that choosing computer science classes and using the Titan Degree Audit program was confusing. Therefore, we created 	Class Planner to create an ease of access for students to record, calculate, and plan their classes.
# Who
This project is aimed toward computer science students at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF). It could be scaled to all majors within or all majors in all schools as well because our database is created through school websites.
# When
Our projected goal is to complete the first sprint by February 29th, 2020. Our biggest delay would be accomplishing the document and tying our functionalities together. Other challenges would include the prerequisite functionality, and GPA/unit calculator.
# Estimation
The program will have multiple iterations before a final release. At first, the program will be finished with a demo that can calculate and record classes for computer science students from CSUF. Afterward, the iteration would include general education classes, and eventually, include other majors. In terms of features, a class planner application would be added to help students plan their future classes. Finally, a last iteration would include other local schools.
